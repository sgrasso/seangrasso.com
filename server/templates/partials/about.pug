					| My full stack experience goes beyond JS to languages such as Coldfusion and several others, but my primary interest and expertise evolves around everything JavaScript and Node.js.  I am an experienced advocate for docker container usage and a DevOps support structure.  You can usually always find me being a geek and hacking something.  I hope to add lots of parts and pieces I've built here and maybe even a blog or two.  I am a busy father of 3, but enjoy an extensive knowledge and interest in the game of baseball. If you feel inclined to learn more or have a project in need of a senior level engineer feel free to drop me a line.
