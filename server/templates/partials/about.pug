					| My full stack experience goes beyond JS to languages such as Coldfusion and several others but my primary interest and expertise evolves around everything JavaScript and Node.js.  You can usually always find me being a geek and hacking something.  I hope to add lots of parts and pieces I've built here and maybe even a blog or two.  I am a busy father but enjoy an extensive knowledge and interest in the game of baseball. If you feel inclined to learn more feel free to drop me a line.
